Basic Tsiolkowsky Calculator: 
Inputs:

ISP: The Isp of the Engine, in seconds

Starting Mass: The total System mass at the start of the burn, in kg

Final Mass: The Total System Mass at the End of the burn, in kg

Delta V Calculator. Calculate achievable Delta V
Inputs:

Num. of Stages: Number of Rocket Stages

Launch Mass: Launch Mass of Rocket, EXCLUDING Payload Mass, in kg

First Engine ISP: Isp of the first Engine in s


Click Button "Add later Stage Isps" in order to specify Isps for furtherStages after the first one
If not done, it is assumed that later stages have the same Isp as the first Engine


Click Button "Add Fuel Masses" in order to specify the mass of fuel for each Stage
Can only be specified if a list of Stage Masses is also specified
If not done, a structure factor of 12% is assumed for each Stage


Click Button "Add Stage Masses" in order to specify the masses of each individual stage 
(such that the sum of the stage masses is equal to the launch mass)
If not done, an optimal relative stage size is determined and used
2
Determine Required launch mass to achieve given mission parameters

Inputs:

Number of Stages: Number of rocketstages

First Engine Isp: Isp of first stage Engine in s

Structural Factor: (Stage Dry Mass)/(Stage Mass)

target delta v: Delta V rocket must achieve in m/s

divergence Limit: Mass for which the iteration is considered diverged in kg

Stage Rel. Mass: Relative Mass between Stage n+1 and Stage n
If not given, an optimal ratio is determined and used
3
Determine Required launch mass to achieve given mission parameter across a range of Isp or Mu (structural factor) Values
Inputs:

Number of Stages: Number of Stages

Payload Mass: Mass of Payload in kg

target delta v: Delta V rocket must achieve in m/s

divergence Limit: Mass for which the iteration is considered diverged in kg

Structure Factor: Structure Factor of Rocket

Click Button "Add later Stage ISPs" to specify Isps of later Stages
If not done, they are assumed to be equal to Isp, Stage 1

Determine the Mass (and Volume) of the required Mission propellant
Inputs:

Isp, Stage 1: First Engine Isp in s

Payload Mass: Mass of Payload in kg

Structure Factor: Structure Factor (Stage Dry Mass)/(Stage Mass)

Target Delta V: Delta V that must be achieved in m/s

Stage Rel. Mass: Relative Stage Sizing, (Mass Stage n+1)/(Mass Stage n)
If not given, the optimal value is determined and used

Convergence limit: Mass at which sizing iteration is considered diverged, in kg

Mixture Ratio: Mass flow Ratio Oxidiser/Fuel

Densities (Ox, Fu): Density of Oxidiser and Fuel in kg/m^3

Fueltype: Type of Fuel, supports "HydroLox", "KeroLox", "MethaLox"
If Fueltype is specified, densities and mixture ratios are taken from known typical values

If both Fueltype and Mixture Ratio or Fueltype and Densities are given, the specified Density/Mixture Ratio is used


Known Fuel Values:

"HydroLox": Mixture Ratio = 6 // Densities = (1140, 71)

"KeroLox": Mixture Ratio = 2.3 // Densities = (1140, 800)

"MethaLox": Mixture Ratio = 3.5 // Densities = (1140, 423)
